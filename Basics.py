# we get 1181 number of duplicate entries in googleplaystore data set.instead of removing randomly duplicate entries im going to keep most recently updated data and remove rest of the data

# # For IOS

# # Most popular app by genre in ios

# Here we going to check popularity of apps by counting number of installs by users.It will show us which genre is more popular among users

# Here installs is directly given.so we can find frequency table directly from our used defined function which we created in In[44] to find percentage of each install numbers.However the number is not accurate because it just dont give us auctual number of installs just give eg (10000+) rough figures.Anyway we going to take it as 10000(there is no way).To get a error free code we should replace '+' sign and ',' by just '' and convert the value to float for add up . After that we can easily addup the number of installs based on catagory on android apps.
